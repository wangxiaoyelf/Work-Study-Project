Project Name: Copyright date finder projectDescription: This project is to create a database that will match up information obtained on where the copyright symbols are located and dates seen on the page. There are three kinds of files, which are catresults files, date files and joinedcaseb files. The catresults files store the information about copyright symbols’ id number and the related triples. The date files contains the information on what date is on which page. Some other information for the record id are obtained from the joinedcaseb files in columns 8-34.Last edited on: July 18, 2016Author: Xiaoyi WangSystem requirements: Windows 8 or higher or Mac OS X; Memory: at least 2G; Hard drive: at least 4G; Python3.5.1; MySQL Database (Server & Workbench).The codes are divided into three parts, which are dataformat, datamodel and dataparser. Dataformat and datamodel can be considered as libraries and are imported to dataparser.Python Setup Procedures: 1. Rename the catresults and the joinedcaseb files in different copyright folders as catresults/joinedcaseb_copyrightFolderName.txt (e.g. catresults_copyrightedSymbol.txt; joinedcaseb_copyrightedSymbol.txt). 2. Store all the date files named UKpageresults_xxxx in one folder. 3. Edit the “DATE_FILE_PATH” variable in the dataparser file to the directory where the date files folder is located in your computer. 4. Create a new folder and put all the renamed cateresults, joinedcaseb files and the date files folder, together with the dataformat, datamodel and dataparser codes files in that folder.5. Launch python3 and change the work directory to the folder created in step 4.6. Run dataparser.py file and an output file named “OUTPUT_FILE_NAME”, which can be edited in dataparser.py, will be in the current work directory folder. MySQL Database Setup Procedures:1. Assure MySQL Server status is “running” and then launch MySQL Workbench.2. Open SQL Script “Load_data_script.sql” in MySQL Workbench.3. Change the script’s last line “LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:\\YourPath\\To\\date_finder_result.txt'…” to the directory where the result file (obtained in Python Setup Procedure step 6) is located.4. Run the script and a new database containing a table of the result data will be created.
